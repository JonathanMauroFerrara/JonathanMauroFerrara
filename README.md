### <h2>My journey</h2> 
- :mortar_board: I graduated in computer science from ISIS Facchinetti where **my passion for programming was born!**
- :books: After the school i've continued study programming in the evening, after my current job.

- :school: I was a student of TommorowDevs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TomorrowDevs is a community where there are Mentors who follow me. They give you material for study <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and **many projects** to work on for improve your skills with the practice. So i learned by doing!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for Koodit, is a web services company. I manage, develop and support all the web application or web site for our customers! <br  >

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improve my skills with React and sometimes i do some code challenge for improve my logic skill.

- âš¡ Motivational fact: **Those who think they can and those who think they can't are both usually right.**
<br>


### <h2>My Experience so far!</h2>

As a frontend developer in Koodit I have faced several challenges and overcome various obstacles. What I have certainly learned so far is how to deal with the non-comfort zone. I am constantly engaged in projects that require know-how that I do not initially possess and that I build during the project development process.
I am currently part of a team consisting of myself and a colleague, with her I face various challenges that come to us. In this company I basically learned to:
- Manage medium to large projects
- Knowing how to communicate effectively
- Teamwork is essential
- How to deal with every single obstacle or challenge by putting yourself out there
- Work for objectives

The rest is to be discovered!
