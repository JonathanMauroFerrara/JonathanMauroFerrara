### <h2>My journey</h2> 
- :mortar_board: I graduated in computer science from ISIS Facchinetti where **my passion for programming was born!**
- :books: After the school i've continued study programming in the evening, after my current job.

- :school: I am currently a student of TommorowDevs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TomorrowDevs is a community where there are Mentors who follow me. They give me material for study <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and **many projects** to work on for improve my skills with the practice. So i learn by doing!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an Web App as team leader. it's a image recognigtion app! <br  >
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the link of the repo for more info! -> [Web App Repo](https://github.com/TD-team3/img-recognition-web-app-fe) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the deploy -> [Web App](https://gracious-mcclintock-220460.netlify.app/index.html)

- :tram:At the moment, i'm working as railway electronic laboratory technician. I like what i do, but it's not my dream job! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna be a Front-end developer!


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-fff?&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=ddc508)  and  ![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-fff?&logo=SASS&logoColor=blue) using ![WEBPACK](https://img.shields.io/badge/-WEBPACK-fff?&logo=WEBPACK&logoColor=lightblue) as bundler

- âš¡ Motivational fact: **Those who think they can and those who think they can't are both usually right.**
<br>


### <h2>Team leader Experience </2>
As Team leader i've learned a lot of stuff! :blush:
- Working with others it's super useful! Sharing ideas and information eachother is like a boost :rocket: for my **creativity** and **opened my mind** :open_mouth:
- Working as a team in the same development environment pushed me to write code **clean and understandable way as possibile** :construction_worker:
- **Communication**  in a team is the ** :key: to success**, i tried to respect others and their ideas trying to always **find a meeting point**
- **Not being ashamed** to ask for help :raising_hand: was something I worked on a lot in this project, also pushing others to show their doubts and trying to solve them together
- Leaving the comfort zone :no_entry: and using new technologies in order to learn as much as possible was another point on which I worked a lot together with the team.
